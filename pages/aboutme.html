			<div class="blurb">I am an incoming Freshman at Utah State University, studying Mechanical Engineering. I am interested in most branches
			of engineering, but Mechanical and Computer Engineering in particular fascinate me. I have been making engineering projects since middle
			school, when I took my first robotics and engineering design classes. 
			<br><br> You can find a summary of those projects <a href="projects.html" class="doc-link">here</a>.
			<br><br> Although I really like both Mechanical and Computer Engineering, when it came time for me to decide on my major, I went with Mechanical.
			This is because even though I really appreciate the work that accompanies computers, CAD software is my forte. As of writing this web page, I have 
			experience with Autodesk Inventor, Fusion360, Onshape, and Blender. During my first semester at USU, I will also be learning Solidworks. Of the 5, 
			I have taught classes for over 3 months on OnShape, and a User certification with Inventor. To accompany these skills, I have a heavy amount of 
			experience working with 3D-printing. I bought my first 3D printer at the end of 8th grade, a <a class="doc-link" href="https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=21666&gclid=CjwKCAjwo4mIBhBsEiwAKgzXOLWN05O30JUoVweHr0u9OqOIgOOAZNEZcJMLxGePXEITsLKBpb5mvBoCC64QAvD_BwE" target="_blank">
			Monoprice Mini Delta</a>. Since then, I have printed countless knick-knacks that have been helpful to me in my daily life. Of course, that also meant 
			learning how the printer worked in order to troubleshoot errors I encountered with it. More recently, I upgraded to a <a class="doc-link" href="https://www.creality.com/goods-detail/cr-10-mini-3d-printer?gclid=CjwKCAjwo4mIBhBsEiwAKgzXOCiLQLzl26PRoaMmUDjti1p-oGDivYiKu4cyLd80Pe5iLxsIhNQjJxoC7tkQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">
			Creality CR-10 Mini</a>. While both of these printers have 'Mini' in their name, the CR-10 Mini is far from the minuscule size of the Mini Delta. 
			This printer has allowed me to be much, much more ambitious with my projects, removing my previous size constraint.</div>

			<div class="blurb">Beyond engineering, I have interest and experience in graphic design, rock climbing, and swimming. The summer before 
			my senior year of high school, I taught a class at my local community college on how to use Adobe Illustrator. That experience taught me a lot about how to 
			use Adobe's Creative Cloud. I have since used that knowledge to perform work for a 3D texturing graphics job and, more heavily, this website. </div>
