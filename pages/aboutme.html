				I am currently a Junior at Utah State University, pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering 
				with minors in Mathematics and Consulting. My passion lies in the field of computer engineering and space 
				technology, and I am working towards becoming an expert in high performance embedded software engineering, with 
				a focus on space-grade flight software. I am privileged to be a part of a satellite team and work with the F' 
				framework developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). This hands-on experience with cutting-edge 
				technology and my involvement in exciting projects have given me a solid foundation and a better understanding 
				of my field. I am driven and dedicated to achieving my goals and making a significant impact in the field of 
				computer engineering and space technology.
			<br><br>
				In addition to my work on the satellite team and my studies, I also have experience with various technologies 
				that are critical in my field. I am proficient in Docker, which has become an essential tool for software 
				development and deployment. I have utilized Docker to create containers that act as independent runtime 
				environments, which keeps my development environment sterile and devoid of any unnecessary packages or 
				external dependencies. I also have quite a bit of experience with server deployment, largely in conjunction with
				creating a strong development environment for myself and my coworkers.
				I have a strong understanding of Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime, and have used it to 
				build a variety of applications ranging from simple scripts to complex web applications. These skills and 
				experiences have allowed me to bring value to my work on the satellite team and my future career.

				Beyond engineering, I have interest and experience in graphic design, rock climbing, and swimming. The summer before 
				my senior year of high school, I taught a class at my local community college on how to use Adobe Illustrator. That 
				experience taught me a lot about how to use Adobe's Creative Cloud. I have since used that knowledge to design dozens of 
				professional web pages for Utah State University and myself.
