		<h6>Hey, I'm Kade</h6>
		<p>I come from a family of 7, and I am child 3/5. I was born in Utah, but have moved all around the US. 
			I started in the public school system, but started homeschooling during my last quarter of 2nd grade. 
			I remained homeschooled until 6th grade, when I left for a charter school. The charter school shut down that year,
			so I joined my public middle school for 7th and 8th grades. I then continued on to the public high school
			for my freshman and sophomore years, and then decided to become homeschooled again through quarantine, taking 
			college classes to finish my junior and senior years simultaneously. </p>
