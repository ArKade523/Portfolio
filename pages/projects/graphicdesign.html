			  <div class="blurb">I created this design for a T-Shirt contest for my church's youth conference. The theme was 'beach', and our design constraints 
			  	specified that we had to include the words 'A Great Work' somewhere in the design. 
			  	<br><br>
			  	I had several ideas for what a beach-themed T-Shirt could look like, but the one I settled on was a palm tree. It was easily recognizable 
				beach imagery, which was more than good enough for the contest. I used the trunk of the tree to contain the 'A Great Work' verbage, which 
				was a good way for me to combine two of my constraints. In order to do that, I had to find a font that I liked. I ended up settling on 
				<a class="doc-link" id="bungee" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee" target="_blank">Bungee</a>. From there, I curved the text using the Arc Warp effect,
				since writing the text along an arc did not give me the effect I wanted. I cut slices out of the text to make it feel more like a tree using
				the knife tool. After making the leaves and coconuts, I felt like the design was a bit imbalanced. I experimented with putting a shovel to the 
				right of the tree, but I ended up settling on a beach ball.

			  <div class="blurb">One of the most common uses of my Graphic Design abilities is creating logos for Discord Servers and group chats. This is my 
				favorite of the ones Ihave made. I like the color combination, and the animation turned out better than I could have hoped. I made this logo
				for a math server that I am an admin of, hence the sinusoidal waves.

			  <div class="blurb">This is my website, as you are clearly aware. I built it the summer of 2021, writing all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was
				  difficult at first, but I eventually got the hang of the languages and how they interact well enough to make a decent-looking website. This 
				  project actually started all the way back in my freshman year of high school, when I was directed to make a portfolio website for my engineering
				  classes. We were told to use Google Sites, but I was never satisfied with that. It felt too easy, and I didn't have nearly as much control over
				  the way that it looked as I wanted. This solution is everything that I wanted and more, so I hope that you, reading this, like it.
