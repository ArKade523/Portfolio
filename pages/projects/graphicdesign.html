			  <div class="blurb">I created this design for a T-Shirt contest for my church's youth conference. The theme was 'beach', and our design constraints 
			  	specified that we had to include the words 'A Great Work' somewhere in the design. 
			  	<br><br>
			  	I had several ideas for what a beach-themed T-Shirt could look like, but the one I settled on was a palm tree. It was easily recognizable 
				beach imagery, which was more than good enough for the contest. I used the trunk of the tree to contain the 'A Great Work' verbage, which 
				was a good way for me to combine two of my constraints. In order to do that, I had to find a font that I liked. I ended up settling on 
				<a class="doc-link" id="bungee" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee">Bungee</a>. From there, I curved the text using the Arc Warp effect,
				since writing the text along an arc did not give me the effect I wanted. I cut slices out of the text to make it feel more like a tree using
				the knife tool. After making the leaves and coconuts, I felt like the design was a bit imbalanced. I experimented with putting a shovel to the 
				right of the tree, but I ended up settling on a beach ball.

			  <div class="blurb">One of the most common uses of my Graphic Design abilities is creating logos for Discord Servers and group chats. This is my 
				favorite of the ones Ihave made. I like the color combination, and the animation turned out better than I could have hoped. This logo was 
				made for a math server that I am an admin of.
