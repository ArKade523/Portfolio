	<div class="body home blurb">I built this arcade cabinet at the end of 8th grade. It is run on a Raspberry Pi 3B, with emulators loaded on an open-source, 
	  Linux-based operating system. This project was my first time combining woodworking, rudimentary software engineering, and rudimentary 
	  computer engineering. To this day, it is still one of my favorite projects to ever have worked on.</div>
